    question: 'Why did you start Pepper?',
    answer: `
      We both used to get robocalls pretty often. Since we're both software engineers,
      we thought that this would be the perfect opportunity to build something that solves our
      own problem. It just happens that a lot of people get robocalls too and we thought
      that we should share this solution to other people too.

    question: 'How does Pepper block robocalls?',
    answer: `
      Put simply, Pepper answers calls you get from people that aren't in your contacts 
      list and verified they're a human before sending them over to you. In other words, 
      just like a real-life office receptionist, Pepper doesn't tell you about calls you 
      don't need to get (robocalls!)
    `

  {
    question: 'How is Pepper different from other robocall blocking solutions?',
    answer: `
      Although there are many other robocall blocking solutions with different
      approaches to blocking robocalls, Pepper is special in a few ways.
      First, you only get calls that we've verified are not robocalls. Most other
      solutions just warn you that a caller might be a robocaller.
      We only send you calls that are definitely humans. Second, our success
      robocall blocking rate is extremely high. We haven't had a single spam caller
      get past our filter yet. Lastly, the call quality using our app is better
      than regular phone calls. Just a small bonus!
